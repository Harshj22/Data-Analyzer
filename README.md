Project Overview

Student Data Organizer is a simple menu-driven Python program designed to help users store, view, and manage student data easily.
It allows users to choose between 1D or 2D array structure to save data, demonstrating basic Python concepts like arrays, loops, and user interaction. perfect for beginners learning data structures and user input handling.

FEATURES

✅ 1D Array Mode:
Store simple student information like names or roll numbers in a single-dimensional list.

✅ 2D Array Mode:
Store detailed information (like roll number, name, marks, etc.) in a table-like structure.

✅ User Input Based:
Program asks whether you want to use 1D or 2D array and takes input accordingly.

✅ Display Option:
View all stored data neatly printed in a formatted way.

✅ Menu Driven:
Easy navigation — user can choose what to do next using a simple numbered menu.

CONSEPTS USED

Python Lists (1D and 2D Arrays).
For Loops and Nested Loops.
Conditional Statements.
User Input Handling.
Functions for clean code structure.

HOE IT WORKS

The program first shows a menu asking whether you want to use a 1D or 2D array.
Based on your choice, it lets you enter the number of students and their details.
